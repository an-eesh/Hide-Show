Here's a basic React website that demonstrates showing and hiding text based on a button. The website includes a button that toggles the visibility of text when clicked. This functionality is achieved using React's state management. The text content is displayed conditionally, meaning it appears only when the button is clicked to reveal it. This simple demonstration provides an example of how to implement show/hide functionality in a React application.
